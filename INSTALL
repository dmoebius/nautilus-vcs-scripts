INSTALL
=======

Just copy the Subversion folder into ~/.local/share/nautilus/scripts.
Or just invoke 'make' which does the same.

In older versions of GNOME (before 3.0) the scripts had to be copied
to either ~/.gnome2/nautilus-scripts, ~/.gnome/nautilus-scripts,
~/Nautilus/scripts or ~/.nautilus/scripts, depending on the versions
of GNOME and Nautilus you have.

The scripts are using zenity for user interaction.
